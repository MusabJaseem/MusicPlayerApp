# MusicPlayerApp
# For Shopify: Along with this app, I have created another app which you can checkout in the zahin-mohammad/RuHacks18 repository. Reason I
# did not submit that app is because I created it with my team, not by myself. This MusicPlayerApp I developed myself. That other app is called
# Cooldown TO, also available on the google play store. The purpose of that app is to find the nearest library and community center
# based on the user's current location taken from their phones' GPS. It uses the Toronto Government API to get all the information
# of the libraries and community centres.
# This current app which you are seeing is in its beta stage, currently it plays a song that comes pre-downloaded with the app. You can 
# fast forward in the song and adjust the volume as well. You can also move to different screens and see your playlist.
